# OntoDomLab-Med
OntoDomLab-Med is an ontology of domain labels focused on Medicine. It has been developed within the scope of the 
collaboration of [NOVA CLUNL](https://clunl.fcsh.unl.pt) in the transition of the Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa 
Contemporânea (DLPC) from the [Academia das Ciências de Lisboa](http://www.acad-ciencias.pt/) into a digital version. 
Its purpose is to provide a solid conceptual foundation that facilitates interoperability with TEI Lex-0, as well as improve: 
i) the consistency of domain labelling assignment and ii) the efficiency in what concerns information retrieval.

OntoDomLab-Med is being developed in OWL.
